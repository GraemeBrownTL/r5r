\title{Find snapped locations of input points on street network}
\usage{
find_snap(r5r_core, points, mode = "WALK")
}
\arguments{
\item{r5r_core}{An object to connect with the R5 routing engine, created with
\code{\link[=setup_r5]{setup_r5()}}.}

\item{points}{Either a \verb{POINT sf} object with WGS84 CRS, or a \code{data.frame}
containing the columns \code{id}, \code{lon} and \code{lat}.}

\item{mode}{A string. Which mode to consider when trying to snap the points
to the network. Defaults to \code{WALK}, also allows \code{BICYCLE} and \code{CAR}.}
}
\value{
A data.table with the original points as well as their respective
snapped coordinates on the street network and the Euclidean distance
between original points and their respective snapped location. Points
that could not be snapped show \code{NA} coordinates and \code{found = FALSE}.
}
\description{
R5 tries to snap origin and destination points to the street
network in two rounds. First, it uses a search radius of 300 meters. If the
first round is unsuccessful, then R5 expands the search radius to 1.6 km.
Points that aren't linked to the street network after those two rounds are
returned with \code{NA} coordinates and \code{found = FALSE}. Please note that the
location of the snapped points depends on the transport mode set by the user.
